 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐲 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭!

I'm thrilled to present my recent work on designing a comprehensive college network system using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project, in collaboration with Ayesha Naveed, showcases a LAN (Local Area Network) setup that interconnects various departments, enabling seamless communication and data interchange across the campus.

👉 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬
- 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧: Developed a systematic and well-planned topology that connects multiple departments, ensuring efficient data transmission and reliable connectivity.
- 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝: Integrated routers, switches, and PCs to create an interactive and communicative network environment.
Protocols Implemented:
- 𝐑𝐈𝐏 (𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥): Ensured dynamic routing and efficient data packet forwarding between nodes.
- 𝐒𝐒𝐇 (𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐒𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐥): Enabled secure remote management of network devices.

👉 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐝:
- 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: Upgraded the existing network to enhance overall capabilities and flexibility, meeting the evolving needs of the institution.
- 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: Boosted network performance with faster data transmission and reliable connectivity across departments.
- 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬: Facilitated a higher volume of devices and applications, promoting seamless communication and collaboration among students, faculty, and administrative staff.

This College Network Scenario (CNS) aims to support the college's operational and academic activities with a high-performance network. By modernizing the network infrastructure, the project ensures a robust foundation for current and future technological needs.
